# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboarding

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, analysis, cleaning, querying, visualization, and reporting. It showcases practical skills commonly required for data analyst roles, including Python-based analysis, SQL querying, and business intelligence dashboard creation.

The goal of the project is to transform raw data into meaningful insights and present them through interactive dashboards and professional reports.

---

## Dataset

* Source: *(Add source name or “Public / Synthetic Dataset”)*
* Format: CSV / Excel / Database table
* Size: *(Optional)*
* Description:
  The dataset contains structured data used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance indicators relevant to the business problem.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
* **Power BI** (Data modeling & dashboarding)
* **Gamma** (Presentation creation)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Git & GitHub**

---

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported raw data into Python using Pandas
   * Connected to relational databases using SQL

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed data distributions and trends
   * Identified missing values, outliers, and anomalies
   * Generated summary statistics and visualizations

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handled missing and inconsistent values
   * Standardized data types and formats
   * Created derived and calculated fields

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Wrote SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and join tables
   * Extracted insights directly from PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server
   * Validated Python analysis with SQL results

5. **Dashboard Development**

   * Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
   * Designed KPIs, charts, and filters for business users
   * Focused on clarity, usability, and storytelling

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a structured analytical report
   * Designed a professional presentation using Gamma
   * Summarized insights and recommendations for stakeholders

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend and comparison visualizations
* Interactive filters and slicers
* Clear, business-focused insights

*(Add screenshots or a Power BI link if available)*

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and patterns in the data
* Highlighted actionable insights supported by data
* Demonstrated how data-driven decisions can improve outcomes

*(Optional: Add 2–3 bullet points with specific insights)*
